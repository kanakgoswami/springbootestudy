In the context of REST (Representational State Transfer), there are several components that define the architecture and principles of building web services. These components help create a scalable and loosely coupled system. The key components of REST are:

1. Client: The client initiates the communication by sending requests to the server. The client can be a web browser, mobile application, or any other software that interacts with the RESTful API.

2. Server: The server responds to the client's requests by processing the request and sending back an appropriate response. The server hosts the RESTful API and handles the business logic and data storage.

3. Resources: Resources are the key entities or data objects exposed by the RESTful API. Each resource has a unique identifier (URI) and can be accessed and manipulated by the client through HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

4. Uniform Interface: The uniform interface defines a set of constraints that standardize the way clients interact with resources. It consists of the following four constraints:

   - Identification of resources: Each resource is uniquely identified by its URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). The URI serves as the address to access the resource.

   - Manipulation of resources through representations: Resources are represented in different formats such as JSON, XML, or HTML. The client can retrieve, create, update, or delete a resource by manipulating its representation.

   - Self-descriptive messages: Each request and response should contain sufficient information for the recipient to understand and process the message. This can include headers, status codes, and media type information.

   - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS): The server includes hyperlinks (or URLs) in the response, allowing the client to discover and navigate related resources. This enables a more dynamic and decoupled system.

5. Stateless: REST is stateless, which means the server does not store any client state between requests. Each request from the client must contain all the necessary information for the server to process the request. This simplifies the server's architecture and allows for scalability and reliability.

6. Layered System: A layered system is composed of multiple layers, such as load balancers, caching servers, or proxy servers. Each layer provides specific functionality, and the client is unaware of the internal workings of these layers. This allows for flexibility and modularity in the system architecture.

By adhering to these components and principles, RESTful APIs provide a scalable, interoperable, and flexible architecture for building web services that can be consumed by a wide range of clients.
