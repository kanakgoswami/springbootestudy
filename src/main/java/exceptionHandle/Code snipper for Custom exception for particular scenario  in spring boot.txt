Sure! Here's an example of how you can create a custom exception for a specific scenario in a Spring Boot application:

```java
// CustomException.java
public class CustomException extends RuntimeException {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// CustomExceptionAdvice.java
@ControllerAdvice
public class CustomExceptionAdvice {
    @ExceptionHandler(CustomException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomException(CustomException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}

// YourController.java
@RestController
public class YourController {
    @GetMapping("/your-endpoint")
    public void yourMethod() {
        // Check for your specific scenario
        if (/* your specific condition */) {
            throw new CustomException("Custom exception message");
        }

        // Your code logic if the condition is not met
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have created a `CustomException` class that extends the `RuntimeException` class. This exception is thrown when a specific condition is met in your `YourController` class.

We also have a `CustomExceptionAdvice` class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`, which allows us to handle the `CustomException` globally. In this class, we have defined a method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` that specifically handles the `CustomException` and returns a custom response with a status of `BAD_REQUEST` and the exception message.

Finally, in your `YourController` class, you can throw the `CustomException` when your specific condition is met, and it will be caught and handled by the `CustomExceptionAdvice` class.

Please note that you might need to customize the code according to your specific scenario and requirements.
