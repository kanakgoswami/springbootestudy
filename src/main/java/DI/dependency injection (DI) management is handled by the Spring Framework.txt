The Spring Framework is a powerful and widely used Java framework that provides comprehensive support for DI and Inversion of Control (IoC). DI is a key aspect of the Spring Framework's core functionality, and it enables loose coupling and modular design in applications.

Here's an overview of how the Spring Framework handles DI management:

1. Inversion of Control (IoC) Container: The Spring Framework's IoC container, also known as the ApplicationContext, is responsible for managing and wiring dependencies. It creates and manages objects, known as beans, and handles their lifecycle.

2. Bean Definitions: In Spring, beans are defined using XML configuration, annotations, or Java-based configuration classes. These bean definitions specify the dependencies and their relationships with other beans.

3. Dependency Injection (DI): The Spring Framework provides various mechanisms for DI, such as constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection. Dependencies are resolved and injected into beans based on the defined relationships and the configured wiring method.

4. Annotations: Spring provides annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, and `@Resource` to mark dependencies for injection. These annotations can be used on fields, constructor parameters, or setter methods, depending on the desired injection approach.

5. Component Scanning: Spring supports component scanning, which automatically detects and registers beans based on predefined rules and annotations. Components annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller` are automatically identified and instantiated as beans.

6. Configuration: Spring supports multiple approaches for configuration, including XML-based configuration, annotation-based configuration, and Java-based configuration using `@Configuration` classes. These configurations define the beans and their dependencies.

7. Qualifiers and Profiles: Spring provides qualifiers to differentiate beans of the same type when multiple instances are available. Qualifiers help resolve ambiguities during injection. Additionally, Spring supports profiles to define different sets of beans for different environments or scenarios.

8. AOP and other features: The Spring Framework offers additional features like Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), transaction management, and exception handling, which can be seamlessly integrated with DI.

Both the Spring Framework and Spring Boot build upon these DI management capabilities. Spring Boot, as a framework, provides additional auto-configuration and opinionated defaults to simplify the configuration process, making it easier to build production-ready applications with minimal manual setup.

In conclusion, the Spring Framework, including Spring Boot, provides a comprehensive DI management system through its IoC container and related features. DI is a fundamental aspect of the Spring Framework's functionality, enabling loose coupling, modularity, and testability in Java applications.
