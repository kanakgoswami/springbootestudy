Spring and Spring Boot are both frameworks within the Spring ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and offer different levels of abstraction. Here's a comparison between Spring and Spring Boot:

1. Complexity: Spring is a comprehensive framework that provides a wide range of modules and features for building enterprise applications. It requires manual configuration and setup, which can be more complex and time-consuming. Spring Boot, on the other hand, is built on top of Spring and aims to simplify the development process by providing opinionated defaults and auto-configuration. It reduces the need for manual configuration and allows for a more streamlined development experience.

2. Configuration: In Spring, developers need to configure various components, dependencies, and settings manually using XML configuration files, Java annotations, or Java-based configuration classes. Spring Boot simplifies the configuration process by offering sensible defaults and automatic configuration. It uses a convention-over-configuration approach and externalized configuration properties, making it easier to get started with minimal configuration.

3. Dependency Management: Spring requires explicit management of dependencies by specifying them in the project's build configuration file (e.g., Maven or Gradle). Spring Boot includes a dependency management feature that allows developers to rely on curated sets of dependencies called "starters." Starters simplify the dependency management process by automatically managing compatible versions of libraries and reducing conflicts.

4. Opinionated Defaults: Spring provides flexibility, allowing developers to choose and configure components based on their specific needs. It requires developers to make many decisions during the configuration process. Spring Boot takes an opinionated approach by providing preconfigured defaults for many components, which helps developers get started quickly. These defaults can be easily customized as per the application's requirements.

5. Development Experience: Spring Boot offers a more streamlined development experience compared to Spring. It reduces the amount of boilerplate code, simplifies configuration, and provides powerful features out of the box. Spring Boot's embedded server and auto-configuration make it easy to run and test applications. Spring, on the other hand, offers more fine-grained control and flexibility but requires more configuration and setup.

6. Project Types: Spring is suitable for a wide range of projects, including large-scale enterprise applications that require extensive customization and flexibility. Spring Boot is particularly useful for smaller, standalone applications, microservices, and rapid prototyping, where developers can benefit from its opinionated defaults and faster development process.

In summary, Spring provides extensive flexibility and customization options but requires more configuration and setup. Spring Boot, built on top of Spring, offers an opinionated approach, automatic configuration, and simplified development experience. Spring Boot is a great choice for developers who prefer convention-over-configuration, want to quickly bootstrap projects, and focus on delivering functionality rather than managing infrastructure. Spring is more suitable for complex projects that require fine-grained control and customization.
