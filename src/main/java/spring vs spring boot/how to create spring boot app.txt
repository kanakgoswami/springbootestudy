To create a Spring Boot application, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up your Development Environment**: Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website or use a package manager if available for your operating system. Also, make sure you have a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

2. **Create a New Spring Boot Project**: You can create a new Spring Boot project using either the Spring Initializr website or your IDE.

   - Using Spring Initializr: Visit the [Spring Initializr website](https://start.spring.io/) and provide the project's details, such as project type (Maven or Gradle), programming language (Java, Kotlin, etc.), Spring Boot version, and dependencies. Click on "Generate" to download the project as a ZIP file.

   - Using IDE: Alternatively, you can create a Spring Boot project directly from your IDE. Most modern IDEs have built-in support for Spring Boot project creation. For example, in IntelliJ IDEA, you can select "New Project" and choose "Spring Initializr" as the project type. Follow the prompts to configure your project details, dependencies, and click on "Finish" to create the project.

3. **Open the Project in your IDE**: If you downloaded the project as a ZIP file, extract it to a suitable location on your system. Open the project in your IDE by importing it as an existing Maven or Gradle project, depending on the build tool you selected.

4. **Explore the Project Structure**: Once the project is open in your IDE, you'll see the basic project structure with source code, configuration files, and build files. The main source code is typically located in the `src/main/java` directory.

5. **Customize Application Properties**: Review the `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `src/main/resources/application.yml` file to configure application-specific properties, such as database connection details, server ports, and logging configurations. Modify these properties based on your requirements.

6. **Write Application Code**: Start writing your application code based on your project requirements. You can create Java classes for controllers, services, repositories, and other components. These classes will handle the business logic and expose REST endpoints, database interactions, etc.

7. **Build and Run the Application**: You can build and run your Spring Boot application using your IDE or command-line tools.

   - Using IDE: Most IDEs provide built-in support for running Spring Boot applications. You can right-click on the main class (usually annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) and select the option to run or debug the application.

   - Using Command Line: If you prefer using the command line, navigate to your project's root directory and use the appropriate build tool command (`mvn` for Maven or `./gradlew` for Gradle) to build the project. Then, run the generated JAR file using the `java -jar` command.

8. **Verify the Application**: Once the application is running, you can verify its functionality by accessing the defined endpoints or performing any other required actions. You can use tools like Postman or a web browser to interact with the application's endpoints.

This is a basic overview of creating a Spring Boot application. As you progress, you can explore additional Spring Boot features and frameworks, such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and more, to enhance your application's capabilities.
