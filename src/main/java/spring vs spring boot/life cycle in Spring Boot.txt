In Spring Boot, the lifecycle of a typical application can be divided into several phases, each with its own set of events and callbacks. Here's an overview of the lifecycle phases in a Spring Boot application:

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - **Bootstrap**: This phase initializes the Spring Application Context and sets up the necessary infrastructure for the application. It includes tasks like classpath scanning, loading external configurations, and setting up default property values.

   - **Application Context Creation**: The Spring Application Context is created, and beans are instantiated and wired together based on the defined configurations. Beans may be defined using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or through XML configuration.

2. **Pre-Startup Phase**:
   - **Environment Setup**: The application environment is set up, including loading configuration properties and setting up logging.

   - **Bean Post-processing**: Any registered `BeanPostProcessor` beans are invoked. These processors can modify or enhance the behavior of beans before they are fully initialized.

3. **Startup Phase**:
   - **Application Event Publication**: The application publishes various events, such as `ApplicationStartingEvent`, `ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent`, and `ApplicationPreparedEvent`. These events can be used for custom initialization logic or to listen for specific application events.

   - **Application Context Refresh**: The Spring Application Context is refreshed, and the application beans are fully initialized. Any necessary dependencies are injected, and bean initialization methods are invoked.

   - **Application Started Event**: The `ApplicationStartedEvent` is published, indicating that the application has started and is ready to serve requests.

4. **Running Phase**:
   - **Application Execution**: The application is now running, and it can handle incoming requests or perform any scheduled tasks.

5. **Shutdown Phase**:
   - **Application Shutdown Hook**: When the application is terminated, a shutdown hook is triggered, allowing for graceful shutdown. Beans implementing the `DisposableBean` interface or annotated with `@PreDestroy` are destroyed, and any necessary cleanup operations can be performed.

   - **Application Shutdown Event**: The `ContextClosedEvent` is published, indicating that the application context is being closed.

   - **Resource Cleanup**: Any resources used by the application are released, such as database connections or open file handles.

   - **Application Exit**: The application exits and terminates.

Throughout the lifecycle, Spring Boot provides various extension points and events that allow for customizations and integration with other components. You can leverage these events and callbacks to perform custom initialization logic, interact with the application context, and clean up resources during shutdown.

Note that Spring Boot provides convenient abstractions and auto-configuration features that simplify the lifecycle management, allowing developers to focus on writing application logic rather than intricate configuration details.
