Sure! Here's an example of a basic configuration setup in Spring Boot.

1. Create a Spring Boot project:
   Start by creating a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or by using the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/).

2. Configure application properties:
   Open the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file and configure the necessary properties. These properties can include database connection details, server port, logging settings, etc. Here's an example of an `application.properties` file:

   ```properties
   # Server configuration
   server.port=8080

   # Database configuration
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=secret

   # Logging configuration
   logging.level.org.springframework=INFO
   ```

3. Create a Spring Boot Configuration class:
   Create a configuration class annotated with `@Configuration` that contains additional configuration settings or beans specific to your application. For example, you can define beans for third-party libraries or customize certain aspects of the Spring Boot application. Here's an example:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

   @Configuration
   public class MyAppConfig {
       // Additional configuration or bean definitions
   }
   ```

4. Enable component scanning:
   By default, Spring Boot performs component scanning in the package where the main application class is located and its sub-packages. If your custom configuration class is in a different package, make sure to include the package in component scanning. You can use `@ComponentScan` to specify the base package(s). Here's an example:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan("com.example.myapp")
   public class MyAppConfig {
       // Additional configuration or bean definitions
   }
   ```

5. Run the Spring Boot application:
   Finally, run the Spring Boot application either from your IDE or using the command-line interface. Spring Boot will automatically configure the application based on the properties and the default behavior.

These are the basic steps to configure a Spring Boot application. You can further customize and extend the configuration based on your specific requirements.
