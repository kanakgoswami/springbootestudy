The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a convenient meta-annotation provided by Spring Boot that combines three commonly used annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. 

Here's a breakdown of what each of these annotations does:
@SpringBootConfiguration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan

1. @SpringBootConfiguration or `@Configuration`: This annotation marks the class as a configuration class, indicating that it contains bean definitions and other configuration settings. It allows you to define beans and configure various aspects of the application.

2. `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: This annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism, which automatically configures the application's beans and components based on the classpath and the detected dependencies. It saves developers from having to manually configure many components by providing sensible defaults and reducing boilerplate code.

3. `@ComponentScan`: This annotation tells Spring to scan for components, such as controllers, services, and repositories, within the specified packages. It enables component scanning and automatic bean registration, allowing Spring to discover and instantiate beans based on its classpath scanning.

By using `@SpringBootApplication`, you can combine these three annotations into a single, concise annotation, simplifying the configuration of your Spring Boot application.

Here's an example of using `@SpringBootApplication`:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is added to the main application class. It enables the auto-configuration mechanism, component scanning, and marks the class as a configuration class. This single annotation is equivalent to using `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` separately.

Using `@SpringBootApplication` is a recommended best practice when starting a new Spring Boot application. It simplifies the configuration process and ensures that your application is set up with sensible defaults and automatic configuration, allowing you to focus more on writing business logic and delivering functionality.
